console.log("Hello, World! This is a journey of me learning how to code and program! i really do hope everything goes well for me as i am a newbie to this coding/programming world.

I just didnt know how computers worked but all that has already changed drastically because as they say... PRACTICE MAKES A LITTLE BIT OF PERFECT!")
